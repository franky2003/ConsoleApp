The Online Book Store is a Java program that simulates a basic book store management system. 
Users can interact with the store by performing various actions such as browsing the book catalogue, searching for books, adding items to their shopping cart, placing orders, rating and reviewing books, and more. 
The program uses multi-threading and thread synchronization mechanisms to manage concurrent access to shared data structures.

*Program Flow*

The program begins with the `main` method, which displays the main menu to users.
Users can choose to log in, sign up, or exit the program.
Once logged in, users are presented with a range of actions they can perform within the book store.
Users can interact with the store, browse books, search for books, add books to their cart, place orders, and more.
Users can also rate and review books they have purchased.
The program allows users to log out or exit the program at any time.
